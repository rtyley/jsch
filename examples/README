This directory contains some examples, which demonstrate how to use JSch

- Shell.java
  This program enables you to connect to sshd server and get the shell prompt.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac Shell.java 
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src java Shell
  You will be asked hostname, username and passwd. 
  If everything works fine, you will get the shell prompt. Output will
  be ugly because of lacks of terminal-emulation, but you can issue commands.

- X11Forwarding.java
  This program will demonstrate X11 forwarding.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac X11Forwarding.java 
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src java X11Forwarding
  You will be asked hostname, displayname, username and passwd. 
  If your X server does not run at 127.0.0.1, please enter correct
  displayname. If everything works fine, you will get the shell prompt.
  Try X applications; for example, xlogo.

- Exec.java
  This program will demonstrate remote exec.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac Exec.java 
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src java Exec
  You will be asked hostname, displayname, username. passwd and command.
  If everything works fine, given command will be invoked 
  on the remote side and outputs will be printed out. In this sample,
  X forwarding is enabled, so you can give an X client as a command.

- ViaHTTP.java
  This program will demonstrate the ssh session via HTTP proxy.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac ViaHTTP.java 
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src java ViaHTTP
  You will be asked hostname, proxy-server, username and passwd. 
  If everything works fine, you will get the shell prompt.

- PortForwardingR.java
  This program will demonstrate the port forwarding like option -R of
  ssh command; the given port on the remote host will be forwarded to
  the given host and port  on the local side.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac PortForwardingR.java
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src PortForwardingR
  You will be asked hostname, port:host:hostport, username and passwd. 
  If everything works fine, you will get the shell prompt.
  Try the port on remote host.

- PortForwardingL.java
  This program will demonstrate the port forwarding like option -L of
  ssh command; the given port on the local host will be forwarded to
  the given remote host and port on the remote side.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac PortForwardingL.java
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src PortForwardingL
  You will be asked hostname, port:host:hostport, username and passwd. 
  If everything works fine, you will get the shell prompt.
  Try the port on localhost.

- StreamForwarding.java
  This program will demonstrate the stream forwarding. The given Java
  I/O streams will be forwared to the given remote host and port on
  the remote side.  It is simmilar to the -L option of ssh command,
  but you don't have to assign and open a local tcp port.
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src javac StreamForwarding.java
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../src StreamForwarding
  You will be asked hostname, host:hostport, username and passwd. 
  If everything works fine, System.in and System.out streams will be
  forwared to remote port and you can send messages from command line.
